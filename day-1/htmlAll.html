    <h1>Prime Minister</h1>
    <p>Wintjiya's involvement in contemporary Indigenous Australian art began in 1994 at Haasts Bluff (pictured) when she participated in a group painting project and in the creation of batik fabrics. She was also a printmaker, using drypoint etching. Her paintings typically use an iconography that represents the eggs of the flying ant (waturnuma) and hair-string skirts (nyimparra). Her palette generally involves strong <strong>red or black against a white background</strong>. A finalist in the 2007 and 2008 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, <em>Wintjiya's</em> work is held in several of Australia's public collections, including the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, the National Gallery of Australia, and the National Gallery of Victoria. </p>
